# Toll Plaza Management System with Blockchain  

## Project Description:
Our toll plaza management system proposes the integration
of React into the frontend interface to enhance user interaction
and experience. Additionally, smart contracts written in
Solidity will automate transaction management on the
blockchain. By deploying these contracts onto the blockchain
network, we ensure the integrity and security of toll fee
collection processes. This combination of frontend
enhancements and blockchain-based transaction management
will provide stakeholders with a transparent, efficient, and
secure toll plaza management system.
